            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis day by Private Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I have received the Joyful, and Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble News of the Parliaments Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entering upon the Exerciſe of Their Authority; Which I thought it my Duty to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Immediately to the Officers and Souldiers of Your Garriſon in this Place; and accordingly began with thoſe of my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, Proceeding afterwards to the reſt, and Endeavouring to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115120:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 74 -->ſet it upon all their Hearts, how Extraordinary, and almoſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous the Workings of GOD have been, in bringing to paſs this Your Laſt Return; and how happily Advantageous it is likely to prove to all the Three Nations, and to each Particular Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein. I can give Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the General Acclamations, and all outward Signs that could be rendered of abſolute Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in every man here; neither do I in the leaſt-wiſe Queſtion the Conſent of their Hearts, with the ſenſible Demonſtrations of their Tongues, and Countenances; eſpecially when I Declared to them the many and ſingular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements they have formerly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115120:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 74 -->received from the Parliament; and that they cannot expect the like, from any other Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; beſides the Conſideration of their Reſpective Memberſhip, and Incorporation with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies both Civil and Military un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Your Command.</p>
            <p>We have (GOD be praiſed) during the late Interval, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faithful Servants to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of our Country, and are at preſent in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as to fear nothing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, being ſo well fortified at home.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 75 -->finding the face of things changed at my Return; and my ſelf at a loſs what to do, I was at laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by ſome Perſons, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my ſelf to thoſe who took upon them the Mannagement of Affairs at that time, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly give them the beſt Lights I could, whereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Intereſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in Relation both to <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> after which I forthwith betook my ſelf to this Place, to Act here according to that Truſt, which You had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Repoſed in me: and I hope my preſence hath not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable. But if it ſhall be thought Requiſite, That I come over again to render You a more

               <!-- PDF PAGE 75 -->full Account of my late Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations abroad, I ſhall moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and cheerfully do it: In the mean time, till Your farther Directions, I ſhall Proceed to uſe all care and dilligence here, both for the orderly diſpoſing of the Garriſon, and the vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Enemy, if occaſion require; hoping, That in a ſhort time I ſhall Receive the Honour of Your commands, which ſhall always find a ready and exact Obedience in me, and all that are under my Charge.</p>
            <p>I thought the great Importance of this happy day, would have its effect upon the Spirits of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies round about us, as well as upon our own, though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

            <p>I ſhall daily Pray, That God would crown Your Counſels and Endeavours with Succeſs, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Honeſt and Peaceable Expectation of the Nations under You; and do for my own part give my ſelf up intirely to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by you, as becomes him who is ſo really and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
